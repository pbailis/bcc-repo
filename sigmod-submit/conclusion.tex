\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have developed a necessary and sufficient condition
for maintaining consistency during coordination-free execution of
transactions over shared database state. To do so, we assumed a model
in which users submit explicit integrity constraints to the database,
which subsequently analyzes them for the \iconfluence
property. \iconfluence formalizes the requirement that any two valid
copies of database state can be ``merged'' into a common, valid
database state. We subsequently used this test on a variety of common
integrity constraints and applied these results to the TPC-C
benchmark, analyzing the overheads of coordination when \iconfluence
does not hold.

These initial results indicate that, at least for large-scale
distributed systems, the time for alternative, semantics-based
correctness criteria may have come. As system deployments continue to
scale and geo-replicate, elasticity provided by coordination-avoiding
concurrency control strategies minimize the challenges of maintaining
availability, low latency, and high-performance transaction processing
across database replicas. We accordingly view this theoretical
foundation (with promising real-world deployment results) as the first
steps towards realizing full coordionation-avoiding database systems.
