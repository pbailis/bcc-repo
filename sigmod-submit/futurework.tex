\label{sec:discussion}

In this paper, we have focused on the problem of recognizing when it
is possible to avoid distributed coordination. Here, we discuss
extensions to our approaches and outline areas for future work.

\minihead{Avoiding conflicts} Once a conflicting set of transactions
is identified via \iconfluence analysis, how should the conflict be
avoided? Our system model is amenable to many standard techniques like
backwards validation from optimistic concurrency
control~\cite{bernstein-book,tamer-book}, but the optimal
strategy---as is standard in concurrency control---is
workload-dependent. This hints at an opportunity for ``query
planning'' for coordination avoidance. For example, in a
producer-consumer scenario with an invariant requiring exactly-once
consumption, there are multiple strategies for coordination: all
producers could coordinate, or all consumers, or a mix of the two. The
correct choice depends on the physical location, prevalence, and
distribution of the producing and consuming transactions. Revisiting
heuristics- and statistics-based query planning, specifically
targeting physical layout, choice of concurrency control, and recovery
appears worthwhile. While recent work has used intelligent
partitioning to reduce distributed coordination~\cite{schism}, we see
this as only one aspect of a larger optimization problem.

\minihead{Amortizing coordination} We have analyzed conflicts on a
per-transaction basis, but it is possible to amortize the overhead of
coordination across multiple transactions. For example, the Escrow
transaction method~\cite{escrow} reduces coordination by allocating a
``share'' of non-\iconfluent operations between multiple
processes. For example, in a bank application, a balance of $\$100$
might be divided between five servers, such that each server can
dispense $\$20$ without requiring coordination to enforce a
non-negative balance invariant (servers can coordinate to ``refresh''
supply~\cite{mdcc}). In the context of our \cfreedom analysis, this is
similar to limiting the branching factor of the execution trace to a
some finite factor. We do not attempt a further comparison here but
believe that adapting Escrow and alternative time-, versioned-, and
numerical- drift-based models~\cite{yu-conit} is a promising area for
future work.

\minihead{Future system design} Given our formal grounding and early
quantitative results, what is the appropriate architecture for future
coordination-avoiding databases? Users could express their invariants
in a high-level language like SQL and the system could in turn avoid
and resolve conflicts without their further involvement. Analysis
tools could automatically inform system's conflict resolution policies
as suggested above. We believe this is feasible in the near-term but,
in turn, raises several interesting design and engineering challenges:
for example, as new invariants are added, the system must ensure that
satisfiability is possible. While we have focused on SQL, we might
also consider the use of restricted, \iconfluent operators (e.g.,
Bloom\textsuperscript{L}~\cite{blooml}) and more data types.
