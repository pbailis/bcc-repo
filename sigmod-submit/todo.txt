TO DO

1) Use the formalism presented in section 3 and 4 in some of the examples in
Section 5. Otherwise, as a reader I feel a bit cheated as you ask me
to go through all the formalism, and then not use it again..

Agreed! Working on it. There's a tough trade-off between brevity and giving the reader some satisfaction for all of our formalization.

2) I'd emphasize the solution for sequential ID assignment where 
you assign first a temporary unique iD, and then assign a sequential 
ID on commit. This seems the most interesting of the examples.

Agreed. I can pull this out sooner. Also, if I put it in the "Practice" section instead of the evaluation, it'll come as less of a dirty trick :)



DONE

1.) Change section 5 lead-in.
2.) Change section 6 lead-in.
6.) Discuss undecidability.

3.) Shorted section 6.1.


4.) Elaborate on "discussion" to Section 6.
5.) Add more formalism to section 5.
