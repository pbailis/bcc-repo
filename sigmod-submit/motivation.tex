\label{sec:motivation}

 As Gray and Reuter pithily
summarize: ``engineers can build distributed systems, but few users
know how to program them or have algorithms that use them.''

Data store users today must choose between two options: accept
expensive coordination via strong semantics or, alternatively, reason
about whether low-level weak consistency primitives are sufficient for
their applications.  Programmers using modern, highly
scalable data stores are not only frequently exposed to various
isolation and data consistency anomalies but must, in many cases,
effectively become distributed systems experts in order to reason
about system behavior during communication delays, concurrency, and
failures. Moreover, as evidenced by the proliferation of ``polyglot
persistence'' and the introduction of optional linearizable operations
in traditionally weakly consistent data stores, applications need a
mix of strong and weak models. Managing this trade-off is in turn
challenging: with too much strong consistency, scalability will
unnecessarily suffer, while too little strong consistency may
sacrifice correctness.
