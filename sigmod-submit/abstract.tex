Concurrent access to replicated state results in a fundamental
trade-off between coordination---surfacing in the form of
availability, latency, and scalability---and application-level
consistency, or semantic guarantees for end users. Traditional
mechanisms such as serializable transactions are sufficient to ensure
consistency at the cost of required synchronous coordination, while
weaker guarantees in turn may sacrifice consistency for asynchronous
coordination. In this paper, we identify a necessary and sufficient
condition for \cfree execution without violating application-level
consistency: \fullnameconfluence. By explicitly considering
application-level invariants, \fullnameconfluence analysis allows
databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate
invariants are possible. This forms a theoretical basis for
Coordination-Avoiding Databases that coordinate only when
it is provably necessary to do so. We demonstrate the utility of
\fullnameconfluence analysis via both lightweight static analysis of a
small SQL dialect and a proof-of-concept database prototype.
