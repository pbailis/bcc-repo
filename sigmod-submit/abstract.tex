Concurrent access to shared state results in a fundamental trade-off
between coordination---surfacing in the form of availability, latency,
and scalability---and application-level consistency, or semantic
guarantees for end users. Traditional mechanisms such as serializable
transactions are sufficient to ensure application-level consistency
but require synchronous coordination, while weaker mechanisms in turn
may sacrifice consistency for asynchronous coordination and greater
scale. In this paper, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition
for achieving \cfree execution without violating application-level
consistency: \fullnameconfluence. By explicitly considering
application-level invariants, \fullnameconfluence analysis allows
databases to coordinate between operations only when anomalies that
might violate invariants are possible. This provides a formal basis
for coordination-avoiding database systems, which coordinate only when
it is provably necessary to do so. We demonstrate the utility of
\fullnameconfluence analysis via lightweight static analysis of a
subset of SQL, application analysis, and a proof-of-concept database
prototype.
